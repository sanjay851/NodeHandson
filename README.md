 Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform,javascript runtime enviroment built on chrome's v8 javascript engine.
     that executes javascript code outside a web browser.
     
<h4>Features: </h4>

<h3>1. Asynchronous and Event Driven −</h3> All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. Node.js based server it never waits for an API to return data. 
The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

<h3>2. Very Fast −</h3> Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

<h3>3. Single Threaded −</h3> Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way. which create limited threads to handle requests. 
Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests.
